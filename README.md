# Timestamp

Hi There! 
Timestamp is a Web App for simply logging custom events. When it's done you'll be able to use it! 

I'm developing this app from scratch, from idea to deployment, with Angular and Firebase, **while posting about my progress every day**. It's a 15-day challenge I've taken on myself.

Check out my pages where I post mockups, screenshots, code explained and more:

# About this project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
